[//]: # "Acknowledge contributors to the project; Victoria, Ryan, Harry etc."

I would like to acknowledge Ryan Wright, Harry Volker, Victoria Sacre, and Luke Benson for their teachings and support leading into and throughout this project.

Thank you Ryan for your Git, Jenkins, Nginx, Docker and Ansible training. Victoria for your Python knowledge. Harry for the Flask skills while Ryan was sick. And, lastly Luke for your amazing support and problem solving skills throughout the project week.

Without their support this project would not have been a success.
